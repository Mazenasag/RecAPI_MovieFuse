Joseph, an extra who wants to get into the film industry, agrees to direct the making of and shoot the behind-the-scenes. He takes his role very seriously and starts following around the crew, capturing all this mess... What follows is proof that the making of can sometimes be far better than the film itself!",

    "overview": "Jacob's got problems-deep, mental ones. Desperate for relief, he volunteers for a radical treatment to escape his tortured mind. But instead of peace, he finds himself trapped in a house with a tunnel to his subconscious. What begins as a path to healing becomes a harrowing descent where memory fractures, time distorts, and reality bends. A first-of-its-kind cinematic experience, Soul to Squeeze begins in a boxy 4:3 aspect ratio and ever so slowly widens to a full 2.35:1 by the final frame-mirroring Jacob's expanding perception as he risks everything for redemption. Visually daring and emotionally raw, Soul to Squeeze merges body with mind, taking audiences on a perilous journey through the psyche.",
